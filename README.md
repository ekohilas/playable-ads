#### Abstract
Have you ever clicked the ðŸ’Ž **FREE GEMS** ðŸ’Ž button and been served an ad, only to find you're now trialing a game?

Come along and learn what those ads really are (and how we can use Python to remove them, all while still keeping your precious gems! ðŸ’ŽðŸ˜‰ )

#### Description
Have you ever clicked the *FREE GEMS* button and been served an ad, only to find you're now trialing a game?

What are they? Are they running code? 
If they are, can we hijack them?
If we can't, can we bypass, or even replace them?

And more importantly, what are they actually doing?
Are you really playing a game? Or are they bitcoin miners in disguise?

Come along and join my adventurous curiosity as we learn to man in the middle these ads and discover what they're really about!
